This is the GitHub repository for the paper: E.Koc, İ.Şanlı A. Koç, “Word Embedding Based Basic Level Detection” submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters, 2023. In this study, we aim to automatically identify basic level categories using classical machine learning methods where the features are extracted using word embeddings including W2G, GPT-2 and BERT.
